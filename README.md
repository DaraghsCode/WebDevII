# Flask Web Application
### A Repository for CS5018 WebDevelopment II as taught by Professor Derek Bridge in 2025, UCC.

A simple assignment which requires students to write their own flask web application which must include a database. 
I chose to make a social media platform using SQL,Python(flask & Jinja2),HTML, and CSS.

I'm now looking to make further optimizations and add new more complex features!
